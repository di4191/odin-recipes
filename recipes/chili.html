    <h3>A simple recipe that can be easily modified to fit your taste</h3>
    <p>Chili is truly one of the <strong>best</strong> one-pot meals that exists. It's composed of inexpensive pantry staples. It can be easily modified to exclude meat or to reduce (or <em>increase</em>) spiciness and it has plenty of options for additions. </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add both to a large pot with the olive oil and cook over medium heat until they are soft and transparent. Add the ground beef and continue to saut√© until the beef is fully browned.</li>
        <li>Drain the beans and add them to the pot along with the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, 1 cup water, and all of the ingredients for the chili seasoning. Stir until well combined. Place a lid on the pot and allow it to simmer over a low flame for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally (the flavor gets better the longer it simmers). </li>
