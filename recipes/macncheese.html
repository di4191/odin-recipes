    <h1>Easy Mac And Cheese</h1>

    <h3>If you don't like pasta or cheese, what's wrong with you?</h3>
    <p>There's a reason that there are so many types of macaroni and cheese at the grocery store. It can be a filling side dish or a full meal if you're feeling exceptionally lazy. I mean, can't <em>anything</em> be a full meal if you eat enough of it?</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Elbow Macaroni</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Evaporated Milk</li>
        <li>Grated Cheddar Cheese (or any melting cheese really)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place macaroni in a medium saucepan or skillet and add just enough cold water to cover. Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently. Continue to cook, stirring, until water has been almost completely absorbed and macaroni is just shy of al dente, about 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Immediately add evaporated milk and bring to a boil. Add cheese. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted and liquid has reduced to a creamy sauce, about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with more salt and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
