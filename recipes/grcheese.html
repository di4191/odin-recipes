    <h3>It's cheese and bread. There's not much to it.</h3>
    <p>A favorite of picky children and lazy adults, grilled cheese sandwiches are usually one of the first things that most people learn to make in the kitchen. Pair it with a bowl of tomato soup and you'll have lunch in no time.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>White Bread</li>
        <li>Cheese Slices</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add a slice of cheese (or however many you want). Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side up on top of cheese.</li>
        <li>Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Recall fond childhood memories of grilled cheese and ponder how something so simple can still be this satisfying.</li>
